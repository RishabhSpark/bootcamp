PMC8719639,gr1_lrg.jpg,"Success rates of first-in-human (FIH) studies to approval, Pfizer versus industry, 2016âQ3 2021. (a) Cumulative success rates of FIH (defined as Phase I) through Approval. Cumulative FIH to Approval success rate was calculated as the product of Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and Approval success rates. For both Pfizer success rate and industry benchmarks, a 3-year rolling cohort was used for Phase I and 5-year rolling cohorts for subsequent phases (e.g., 5-year rolling cohort of 2019 represents the 2015â2019 5-year rolling average). The success rate of a specific phase was defined as the percentage of new molecular entities (NMEs) successfully transitioning from that phase to start of the next phase (or registration in the case of Phase III) divided by the total number of outcomes in that phase in any given year. Peer benchmarks were calculated using a similar methodology. The 2021-as-of-end-of-Q3 data point represents either the 3-year rolling average from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2021 for Phase I outcomes, or the 5-year rolling average from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 for outcomes of later phases. (b) Success rates of Phase I NMEs. The Phase I success rate was defined as transition from Phase I to Phase II and calculated using 3-year rolling averages. Sample sizes for Phase I were: NÂ =Â 36 (2016), NÂ =Â 40 (2017), NÂ =Â 42 (2018), NÂ =Â 36 (2019), NÂ =Â 25 (2020), and NÂ =Â 23 (2021 as of end of Q3). (c) Success rates of Phase II NMEs. The Phase II success rate was defined as transition from Phase II to Phase III and calculated using 5-year rolling averages. Sample sizes for Phase II were: NÂ =Â 34 (2016), NÂ =Â 34 (2017), NÂ =Â 32 (2018), NÂ =Â 33 (2019), NÂ =Â 25 (2020), NÂ =Â 25 (2021 as of end of Q3). (d) Cumulative success rates of Phase III and Approval NMEs. Cumulative success rate of Phase III and Approval NMEs was calculated as the product of Phase III and Approval success rates. The Phase III success rate was defined as the transition from Phase III to first regulatory submission in a major market. Approval success rate was defined as the transition from registration to Approval. All were calculated using 5-year rolling averages. Sample sizes for Phase III were: NÂ =Â 9 (2016), NÂ =Â 8 (2017), NÂ =Â 9 (2018), NÂ =Â 9 (2019), NÂ =Â 13 (2020), NÂ =Â 12 (2021 as of end of Q3); and for registration were: NÂ =Â 7 (2016), NÂ =Â 6 (2017), NÂ =Â 9 (2018), NÂ =Â 8 (2019), NÂ =Â 8 (2020), NÂ =Â 10 (2021 as of end of Q3). To declare success at each stage, the program needed to meet both technical and strategic thresholds. The latter was met, wherever feasible, when the overall efficacy/safety profile was superior to the most relevant standard of care (a higher bar than placebo). Specifically, for declaration of proof of concept (POC), which often coincides with the conclusion of Phase II studies, the program needed to meet criteria for starting Phase III development, including the potential of breakthrough value to patients, filling unmet needs, as well as assessment of commercial value, competitive landscape, resources required, and risks.",

PMC8813814,10548_2021_828_Fig2_HTML.jpg,"a Illustration of computational models at the three scales treated here. Microscopic scale: Simple example of two () leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons coupled together, a pyramidal neuron making an excitatory synapse to the interneuron, which in turn makes an inhibitory synapse to the pyramidal cell. This minimal circuit implements feedback inhibition, as the pyramidal cell, when activated, will excite the interneuron, which in turn will inhibit it. In the equation,  is the membrane potential of each of the two cells ;  is the leak, or resting potential of the cells; R is a constant corresponding to the membrane resistance;  is the synaptic input that each cell receives from the other, and possibly background input;  is the time constant determining how quickly  decays. The model is simulated by setting a firing threshold, at which, when reached, a spike is recorded and  is reset to . Mesoscopic scale: The WilsonâCowan-model, in which an excitatory (E) and an inhibitory (I) population are coupled together. The mean field equations describe the mean activity of a large number of neurons.  and  are sigmoid transfer functions whose values indicate how many neurons in the population reach firing threshold, and / are external inputs like background noise.  and  are constants correponding to the strength of self-excitation/inhibition, and  and  the strength of synaptic coupling between populations. Macroscopic scale: In order to simulate long-range interactions between cortical and even subcortical areas, brain network models couple together many mesoscopic (âlocalâ) models using the connection weights defined in the empirical structural connectivity matrix C. The example equation defines the Kuramoto model, in which the phase  of each node n is used as a summary of its oscillatory activity around its natural frequency . Each nodeâs phase depends on the phases of connected nodes p taking into account the time delay , defined by the distances between nodes n and p. k is a global scaling parameter controlling the strength of internode connections. b Illustration of a typical modeling approach at the macroscopic scale. Activity is simulated for each node using the defined macroscopic model, e.g. the Kuramoto model from panel a, right. The feature of interest is then computed from this activity. Shown here is the functional connectivity, e.g., phase locking values between nodes (TableÂ 1). This can then be compared to the empirical functional connectivity matrix computed in exactly the same way from experimental data, e.g. by correlating the entries of the matrix. The model fit can be determined depending on parameters of the model, e.g. the scaling parameter k or the unit speed, here indicated with âtauâ",
