PMC8719639,Achieving end-to-end success in the clinic: Pfizerâs learnings on R&D productivity,"Over the past decade, Pfizer has focused efforts to improve its research and development (R&D) productivity. By the end of 2020, Pfizer had achieved an industry-leading clinical success rate of 21%, a tenfold increase from 2% in 2010 and well above the industry benchmark of â¼11%. The company had also maintained the quality of innovation, because 75% of its approvals between 2016 and 2020 had at least one expedited regulatory designation (e.g., Breakthrough Therapy). Pfizerâs Signs of Clinical Activity (SOCA) paradigm enabled better decision-making and, along with other drivers (biology and modality), contributed to this productivity improvement. These laid a strong foundation for the rapid and effective development of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine with BioNTech, as well as the antiviral candidate Paxlovidâ¢, under the companyâs âlightspeedâ paradigm."
PMC9127978,Pathological sequelae of long-haul COVID,"The world continues to contend with successive waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fueled by the emergence of viral variants. At the same time, persistent, prolonged and often debilitating sequelae are increasingly recognized in convalescent individuals, named âpost-COVID-19 syndromeâ or âlong-haul COVIDâ. Clinical symptomatology includes fatigue, malaise, dyspnea, defects in memory and concentration and a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes as the major manifestations, and several organ systems can be involved. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood at present. This Review details organ-specific sequelae of post-COVID-19 syndromes and examines the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms available so far, elaborating on persistent inflammation, induced autoimmunity and putative viral reservoirs. Finally, we propose diagnostic strategies to better understand this heterogeneous disorder that continues to afflict millions of people worldwide."
PMC10855981,Personalized Multimodal Lifestyle Intervention as the Best-Evidenced Treatment for Chronic Pain: State-of-the-Art Clinical Perspective,"Chronic pain is the most prevalent disease worldwide, leading to substantial disability and socioeconomic burden. Therefore, it can be regarded as a public health disease and major challenge to scientists, clinicians and affected individuals. Behavioral lifestyle factors, such as, physical (in)activity, stress, poor sleep and an unhealthy diet are increasingly recognized as perpetuating factors for chronic pain. Yet, current management options for patients with chronic pain often do not address lifestyle factors in a personalized multimodal fashion. This state-of-the-art clinical perspective aims to address this gap by discussing how clinicians can simultaneously incorporate various lifestyle factors into a personalized multimodal lifestyle intervention for individuals with chronic pain. To do so the available evidence on (multimodal) lifestyle interventions targeting physical (in)activity, stress, sleep and nutritional factors, specifically, was reviewed and synthetized from a clinical point of view. First, advise is provided on how to design a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach for a specific patient. Subsequently, best-evidence recommendations on how to integrate physical (in)activity, stress, sleep and nutritional factors as treatment targets into a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach are outlined. Evidence supporting such a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach is growing, but further studies are needed."
PMC11739813,A review of large language models and autonomous agents in chemistry,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization. This review highlights LLM capabilities in these domains and their potential to accelerate scientific discovery through automation. We also review LLM-based autonomous agents: LLMs with a broader set of tools to interact with their surrounding environment. These agents perform diverse tasks such as paper scraping, interfacing with automated laboratories, and synthesis planning. As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods. Due to the quick pace of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: ."
PMC10326383,BNLoop-GAN: a multi-loop generative adversarial model on brain network learning to classify Alzheimerâs disease,"Recent advancements in AI, big data analytics, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have revolutionized the study of brain diseases such as Alzheimerâs Disease (AD). However, most AI models used for neuroimaging classification tasks have limitations in their learning strategies, that is batch training without the incremental learning capability. To address such limitations, the systematic Brain Informatics methodology is reconsidered to realize evidence combination and fusion computing with multi-modal neuroimaging data through continuous learning. Specifically, we introduce the BNLoop-GAN (Loop-based Generative Adversarial Network for Brain Network) model, utilizing multiple techniques such as conditional generation, patch-based discrimination, and Wasserstein gradient penalty to learn the implicit distribution of brain networks. Moreover, a multiple-loop-learning algorithm is developed to combine evidence with better sample contribution ranking during training processes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a case study on the classification of individuals with AD and healthy control groups using various experimental design strategies and multi-modal brain networks. The BNLoop-GAN model with multi-modal brain networks and multiple-loop-learning can improve classification performance."

PMC10190110,"Advances in human intracranial electroencephalography research, guidelines and good practices","Since the second-half of the twentieth century, intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), including both electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG), has provided an intimate view into the human brain. At the interface between fundamental research and the clinic, iEEG provides both high temporal resolution and high spatial specificity but comes with constraints, such as the individualâs tailored sparsity of electrode sampling. Over the years, researchers in neuroscience developed their practices to make the most of the iEEG approach. Here we offer a critical review of iEEG research practices in a didactic framework for newcomers, as well addressing issues encountered by proficient researchers. The scope is threefold: (i) review common practices in iEEG research, (ii) suggest potential guidelines for working with iEEG data and answer frequently asked questions based on the most widespread practices, and (iii) based on current neurophysiological knowledge and methodologies, pave the way to good practice standards in iEEG research. The organization of this paper follows the steps of iEEG data processing. The first section contextualizes iEEG data collection. The second section focuses on localization of intracranial electrodes. The third section highlights the main pre-processing steps. The fourth section presents iEEG signal analysis methods. The fifth section discusses statistical approaches. The sixth section draws some unique perspectives on iEEG research. Finally, to ensure a consistent nomenclature throughout the manuscript and to align with other guidelines, e.g., Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) and the OHBM Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS), we provide a glossary to disambiguate terms related to iEEG research."

PMC6516866,Chemistry of MRI Contrast Agents: Current Challenges and New Frontiers,"Tens of millions of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams are performed annually around the world. The contrast agents, which improve diagnostic accuracy, are almost exclusively small, hydrophilic gadolinium(III) based chelates. In recent years concerns have arisen surrounding the long term safety of these compounds, and this has spurred research into alternatives. There has also been a push to develop new molecularly targeted contrast agents or agents that can sense pathological changes in the local environment. This comprehensive review describes the state of the art of clinically approved contrast agents, their mechanism of action, and factors influencing their safety. From there we describe different mechanisms of generating MR image contrast such as relaxation, chemical exchange saturation transfer, and direct detection and the types of molecules that are effective for these purposes. Next we describe efforts to make safer contrast agents either by increasing relaxivity, increasing resistance to metal ion release, or by moving to gadolinium(III)-free alternatives. Finally we survey approaches to make contrast agents more specific for pathology either by direct biochemical targeting or by the design of responsive or activatable contrast agents."
PMC9251372,The Impact of Pedagogical Agents' Gender on Academic Learning: A Systematic Review,"Virtual learning environments often use virtual characters to facilitate and improve the learning process. These characters, known as pedagogical agents, can take on different roles, such as tutors or companions. Research has highlighted the importance of various characteristics of virtual agents, including their voice or non-verbal behaviors. Little attention has been paid to the gender-specific design of pedagogical agents, although gender has an important influence on the educational process. In this article, we perform an extensive review of the literature regarding the impact of the gender of pedagogical agents on academic outcomes. Based on a detailed review of 59 articles, we analyze the influence of pedagogical agents' gender on students' academic self-evaluations and achievements to answer the following questions: (1) Do students perceive virtual agents differently depending on their own gender and the gender of the agent? (2) Does the gender of pedagogical agents influence students' academic performance and self-evaluations? (3) Are there tasks or academic situations to which a male virtual agent is better suited than a female virtual agent, and vice versa, according to empirical evidence? (4) How do a virtual agent's pedagogical roles impact these results? (5) How do a virtual agent's appearance and interactive capacities impact these results? (6) Are androgynous virtual agents a potential solution to combatting gender stereotypes? This review provides important insight to researchers on how to approach gender when designing pedagogical agents in virtual learning environments."
PMC9352757,Visualization of micro-agents and surroundings by real-time multicolor fluorescence microscopy,"Optical microscopy techniques are a popular choice for visualizing micro-agents. They generate images with relatively high spatiotemporal resolution but do not reveal encoded information for distinguishing micro-agents and surroundings. This study presents multicolor fluorescence microscopy for rendering color-coded identification of mobile micro-agents and dynamic surroundings by spectral unmixing. We report multicolor microscopy performance by visualizing the attachment of single and cluster micro-agents to cancer spheroids formed with HeLa cells as a proof-of-concept for targeted drug delivery demonstration. A microfluidic chip is developed to immobilize a single spheroid for the attachment, provide a stable environment for multicolor microscopy, and create a 3D tumor model. In order to confirm that multicolor microscopy is able to visualize micro-agents in vascularized environments, in vitro vasculature network formed with endothelial cells and ex ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane are employed as experimental models. Full visualization of our models is achieved by sequential excitation of the fluorophores in a round-robin manner and synchronous individual image acquisition from three-different spectrum bands. We experimentally demonstrate that multicolor microscopy spectrally decomposes micro-agents, organic bodies (cancer spheroids and vasculatures), and surrounding media utilizing fluorophores with well-separated spectrum characteristics and allows image acquisition with 1280  1024 pixels up to 15 frames per second. Our results display that real-time multicolor microscopy provides increased understanding by color-coded visualization regarding the tracking of micro-agents, morphology of organic bodies, and clear distinction of surrounding media."
PMC9580861,"Uncertainty Visualization: Concepts, Methods, and Applications in Biological Data Visualization","This paper provides an overview of uncertainty visualization in general, along with specific examples of applications in bioinformatics. Starting from a processing and interaction pipeline of visualization, components are discussed that are relevant for handling and visualizing uncertainty introduced with the original data and at later stages in the pipeline, which shows the importance of making the stages of the pipeline aware of uncertainty and allowing them to propagate uncertainty. We detail concepts and methods for visual mappings of uncertainty, distinguishing between explicit and implict representations of distributions, different ways to show summary statistics, and combined or hybrid visualizations. The basic concepts are illustrated for several examples of graph visualization under uncertainty. Finally, this review paper discusses implications for the visualization of biological data and future research directions."
