PMC8719639,Achieving end-to-end success in the clinic: Pfizerâs learnings on R&D productivity,"Over the past decade, Pfizer has focused efforts to improve its research and development (R&D) productivity. By the end of 2020, Pfizer had achieved an industry-leading clinical success rate of 21%, a tenfold increase from 2% in 2010 and well above the industry benchmark of â¼11%. The company had also maintained the quality of innovation, because 75% of its approvals between 2016 and 2020 had at least one expedited regulatory designation (e.g., Breakthrough Therapy). Pfizerâs Signs of Clinical Activity (SOCA) paradigm enabled better decision-making and, along with other drivers (biology and modality), contributed to this productivity improvement. These laid a strong foundation for the rapid and effective development of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine with BioNTech, as well as the antiviral candidate Paxlovidâ¢, under the companyâs âlightspeedâ paradigm."
PMC9127978,Pathological sequelae of long-haul COVID,"The world continues to contend with successive waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fueled by the emergence of viral variants. At the same time, persistent, prolonged and often debilitating sequelae are increasingly recognized in convalescent individuals, named âpost-COVID-19 syndromeâ or âlong-haul COVIDâ. Clinical symptomatology includes fatigue, malaise, dyspnea, defects in memory and concentration and a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes as the major manifestations, and several organ systems can be involved. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood at present. This Review details organ-specific sequelae of post-COVID-19 syndromes and examines the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms available so far, elaborating on persistent inflammation, induced autoimmunity and putative viral reservoirs. Finally, we propose diagnostic strategies to better understand this heterogeneous disorder that continues to afflict millions of people worldwide."
PMC10855981,Personalized Multimodal Lifestyle Intervention as the Best-Evidenced Treatment for Chronic Pain: State-of-the-Art Clinical Perspective,"Chronic pain is the most prevalent disease worldwide, leading to substantial disability and socioeconomic burden. Therefore, it can be regarded as a public health disease and major challenge to scientists, clinicians and affected individuals. Behavioral lifestyle factors, such as, physical (in)activity, stress, poor sleep and an unhealthy diet are increasingly recognized as perpetuating factors for chronic pain. Yet, current management options for patients with chronic pain often do not address lifestyle factors in a personalized multimodal fashion. This state-of-the-art clinical perspective aims to address this gap by discussing how clinicians can simultaneously incorporate various lifestyle factors into a personalized multimodal lifestyle intervention for individuals with chronic pain. To do so the available evidence on (multimodal) lifestyle interventions targeting physical (in)activity, stress, sleep and nutritional factors, specifically, was reviewed and synthetized from a clinical point of view. First, advise is provided on how to design a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach for a specific patient. Subsequently, best-evidence recommendations on how to integrate physical (in)activity, stress, sleep and nutritional factors as treatment targets into a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach are outlined. Evidence supporting such a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach is growing, but further studies are needed."
PMC11739813,A review of large language models and autonomous agents in chemistry,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization. This review highlights LLM capabilities in these domains and their potential to accelerate scientific discovery through automation. We also review LLM-based autonomous agents: LLMs with a broader set of tools to interact with their surrounding environment. These agents perform diverse tasks such as paper scraping, interfacing with automated laboratories, and synthesis planning. As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods. Due to the quick pace of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: ."
PMC10326383,BNLoop-GAN: a multi-loop generative adversarial model on brain network learning to classify Alzheimerâs disease,"Recent advancements in AI, big data analytics, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have revolutionized the study of brain diseases such as Alzheimerâs Disease (AD). However, most AI models used for neuroimaging classification tasks have limitations in their learning strategies, that is batch training without the incremental learning capability. To address such limitations, the systematic Brain Informatics methodology is reconsidered to realize evidence combination and fusion computing with multi-modal neuroimaging data through continuous learning. Specifically, we introduce the BNLoop-GAN (Loop-based Generative Adversarial Network for Brain Network) model, utilizing multiple techniques such as conditional generation, patch-based discrimination, and Wasserstein gradient penalty to learn the implicit distribution of brain networks. Moreover, a multiple-loop-learning algorithm is developed to combine evidence with better sample contribution ranking during training processes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a case study on the classification of individuals with AD and healthy control groups using various experimental design strategies and multi-modal brain networks. The BNLoop-GAN model with multi-modal brain networks and multiple-loop-learning can improve classification performance."
