    "abstract":"Over the past decade, Pfizer has focused efforts to improve its research and development (R&D) productivity. By the end of 2020, Pfizer had achieved an industry-leading clinical success rate of 21%, a tenfold increase from 2% in 2010 and well above the industry benchmark of \u00e2\u0088\u00bc11%. The company had also maintained the quality of innovation, because 75% of its approvals between 2016 and 2020 had at least one expedited regulatory designation (e.g., Breakthrough Therapy). Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Signs of Clinical Activity (SOCA) paradigm enabled better decision-making and, along with other drivers (biology and modality), contributed to this productivity improvement. These laid a strong foundation for the rapid and effective development of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine with BioNTech, as well as the antiviral candidate Paxlovid\u00e2\u0084\u00a2, under the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098lightspeed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 paradigm."

    "abstract":"The world continues to contend with successive waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fueled by the emergence of viral variants. At the same time, persistent, prolonged and often debilitating sequelae are increasingly recognized in convalescent individuals, named \u00e2\u0080\u0098post-COVID-19 syndrome\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098long-haul COVID\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Clinical symptomatology includes fatigue, malaise, dyspnea, defects in memory and concentration and a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes as the major manifestations, and several organ systems can be involved. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood at present. This Review details organ-specific sequelae of post-COVID-19 syndromes and examines the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms available so far, elaborating on persistent inflammation, induced autoimmunity and putative viral reservoirs. Finally, we propose diagnostic strategies to better understand this heterogeneous disorder that continues to afflict millions of people worldwide."

    "abstract":"Machine learning models are poised to make a transformative impact on chemical sciences by dramatically accelerating computational algorithms and amplifying insights available from computational chemistry methods. However, achieving this requires a confluence and coaction of expertise in computer science and physical sciences. This Review is written for new and experienced researchers working at the intersection of both fields. We first provide concise tutorials of computational chemistry and machine learning methods, showing how insights involving both can be achieved. We follow with a critical review of noteworthy applications that demonstrate how computational chemistry and machine learning can be used together to provide insightful (and useful) predictions in molecular and materials modeling, retrosyntheses, catalysis, and drug design."

    "title":"The application of machine learning in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases",
    "abstract":"With the development of artificial intelligence(AI) in computer science and statistics, it has been further applied to the medical field. These applications include the management of infectious diseases, in which machine learning has created inroads in clinical microbiology, radiology, genomics, and the analysis of electronic health record data. Especially, the role of machine learning in microbiology has gradually become prominent, and it is used in etiological diagnosis, prediction of antibiotic resistance, association between human microbiome characteristics and complex host diseases, prognosis judgment, and prevention and control of infectious diseases. Machine learning in the field of microbiology mainly adopts supervised learning and unsupervised learning, involving algorithms from classification and regression to clustering and dimensionality reduction. This Review explains crucial concepts in machine learning for unfamiliar readers, describes machine learning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current applications in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, and summarizes important approaches clinicians must be aware of when evaluating research using machine learning."

    "abstract":"Antimicrobial resistance is recognised as one of the top threats healthcare is bound to face in the future. There have been various attempts to preserve the efficacy of existing antimicrobials, develop new and efficient antimicrobials, manage infections with multi-drug resistant strains, and improve patient outcomes, resulting in a growing mass of routinely available data, including electronic health records and microbiological information that can be employed to develop individualised antimicrobial stewardship. Machine learning methods have been developed to predict antimicrobial resistance from whole-genome sequencing data, forecast medication susceptibility, recognise epidemic patterns for surveillance purposes, or propose new antibacterial treatments and accelerate scientific discovery. Unfortunately, there is an evident gap between the number of machine learning applications in science and the effective implementation of these systems. This narrative review highlights some of the outstanding opportunities that machine learning offers when applied in research related to antimicrobial resistance. In the future, machine learning tools may prove to be superbugs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 kryptonite. This review aims to provide an overview of available publications to aid researchers that are looking to expand their work with new approaches and to acquaint them with the current application of machine learning techniques in this field."

    "title":"Suppressing the Spikes in Electroencephalogram via an Iterative Joint Singular Spectrum Analysis and Low-Rank Decomposition Approach",
    "abstract":"The novelty and the contribution of this paper consists of applying an iterative joint singular spectrum analysis and low-rank decomposition approach for suppressing the spikes in an electroencephalogram. First, an electroencephalogram is filtered by an ideal lowpass filter via removing its discrete Fourier transform coefficients outside the  wave band, the  wave band, the  wave band, the  wave band and the  wave band. Second, the singular spectrum analysis is performed on the filtered electroencephalogram to obtain the singular spectrum analysis components. The singular spectrum analysis components are sorted according to the magnitudes of their corresponding eigenvalues. The singular spectrum analysis components are sequentially added together starting from the last singular spectrum analysis component. If the variance of the summed singular spectrum analysis component under the unit energy normalization is larger than a threshold value, then the summation is terminated. The summed singular spectrum analysis component forms the first scale of the electroencephalogram. The rest singular spectrum analysis components are also summed up together separately to form the residue of the electroencephalogram. Next, the low-rank decomposition is performed on the residue of the electroencephalogram to obtain both the low-rank component and the sparse component. The low-rank component is added to the previous scale of the electroencephalogram to obtain the next scale of the electroencephalogram. Finally, the above procedures are repeated on the sparse component until the variance of the current scale of the electroencephalogram under the unit energy normalization is larger than another threshold value. The computer numerical simulation results show that the spike suppression performance based on our proposed method outperforms that based on the state-of-the-art methods."

    "title":"Vibrational Spectroscopic Map, Vibrational Spectroscopy, and Intermolecular Interaction",
    "abstract":"Vibrational spectroscopy is an essential tool in chemical analyses, biological assays, and studies of functional materials. Over the past decade, various coherent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been developed and enabled researchers to study time-correlations of the fluctuating frequencies that are directly related to solute-solvent dynamics, dynamical changes in molecular conformations and local electrostatic environments, chemical and biochemical reactions, protein structural dynamics and functions, characteristic processes of functional materials, and so on. In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and inter-protein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and site-specifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations. In addition, a brief introduction to a newly created repository website (http:\/\/frequencymap.org) for vibrational spectroscopic maps is presented. We anticipate that a combination of the vibrational frequency map approach and state-of-the-art multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy will be one of the most fruitful ways to study the structure and dynamics of chemical, biological, and functional molecular systems in the future."

    "title":"Computational Models in Electroencephalography",
    "abstract":"Computational models lie at the intersection of basic neuroscience and healthcare applications because they allow researchers to test hypotheses in silico and predict the outcome of experiments and interactions that are very hard to test in reality. Yet, what is meant by \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomputational model\u00e2\u0080\u009d is understood in many different ways by researchers in different fields of neuroscience and psychology, hindering communication and collaboration. In this review, we point out the state of the art of computational modeling in Electroencephalography (EEG) and outline how these models can be used to integrate findings from electrophysiology, network-level models, and behavior. On the one hand, computational models serve to investigate the mechanisms that generate brain activity, for example measured with EEG, such as the transient emergence of oscillations at different frequency bands and\/or with different spatial topographies. On the other hand, computational models serve to design experiments and test hypotheses in silico. The final purpose of computational models of EEG is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the EEG signal. This is crucial for an accurate interpretation of EEG measurements that may ultimately serve in the development of novel clinical applications."

    "title":"Pitfalls in EEG Analysis in Patients With Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus: A Preliminary Study",
    "abstract":"Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretations through visual (by human raters) and automated (by computer technology) analysis were still not reliable for the diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). This study aimed to identify typical pitfalls in the EEG analysis and make suggestions as to how those pitfalls might be avoided. Methods: We analyzed the EEG recordings of individuals who had clinically confirmed or suspected NCSE. Epileptiform EEG activity during seizures (ictal discharges) was visually analyzed by 2 independent raters. We investigated whether unreliable EEG visual interpretations quantified by low interrater agreement can be predicted by the characteristics of ictal discharges and individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clinical data. In addition, the EEG recordings were automatically analyzed by in-house algorithms. To further explore the causes of unreliable EEG interpretations, 2 epileptologists analyzed EEG patterns most likely misinterpreted as ictal discharges based on the differences between the EEG interpretations through the visual and automated analysis. Results: Short ictal discharges with a gradual onset (developing over 3\u00e2\u0080\u0085s in length) were liable to be misinterpreted. An extra 2\u00e2\u0080\u0085min of ictal discharges contributed to an increase in the kappa statistics of >0.1. Other problems were the misinterpretation of abnormal background activity (slow-wave activities, other abnormal brain activity, and the ictal-like movement artifacts), continuous interictal discharges, and continuous short ictal discharges. Conclusion: A longer duration criterion for NCSE-EEGs than 10\u00e2\u0080\u0085s that is commonly used in NCSE working criteria is recommended. Using knowledge of historical EEGs, individualized algorithms, and context-dependent alarm thresholds may also avoid the pitfalls."

    "title":"Personalized Multimodal Lifestyle Intervention as the Best-Evidenced Treatment for Chronic Pain: State-of-the-Art Clinical Perspective",
    "abstract":"Chronic pain is the most prevalent disease worldwide, leading to substantial disability and socioeconomic burden. Therefore, it can be regarded as a public health disease and major challenge to scientists, clinicians and affected individuals. Behavioral lifestyle factors, such as, physical (in)activity, stress, poor sleep and an unhealthy diet are increasingly recognized as perpetuating factors for chronic pain. Yet, current management options for patients with chronic pain often do not address lifestyle factors in a personalized multimodal fashion. This state-of-the-art clinical perspective aims to address this gap by discussing how clinicians can simultaneously incorporate various lifestyle factors into a personalized multimodal lifestyle intervention for individuals with chronic pain. To do so the available evidence on (multimodal) lifestyle interventions targeting physical (in)activity, stress, sleep and nutritional factors, specifically, was reviewed and synthetized from a clinical point of view. First, advise is provided on how to design a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach for a specific patient. Subsequently, best-evidence recommendations on how to integrate physical (in)activity, stress, sleep and nutritional factors as treatment targets into a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach are outlined. Evidence supporting such a personalized multimodal lifestyle approach is growing, but further studies are needed."
