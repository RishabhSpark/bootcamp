# Level 0: Basic Script (No Abstraction)

## process.py

This script:

- Reads from `stdin` line by line
- Strips leading and trailing whitespace
- Converts the text to uppercase
- Prints the result to `stdout`

## Constraints
- No functions
- Use only built-in Python tools
- Sequential code only

---

## How to run
```bash
python process.py < input.txt```
